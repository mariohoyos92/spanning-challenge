# ATM

This is a barely-functional ATM built for a coding challenge. 

## Instructions for use

* Clone this repository
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/mariohoyos92/spanning-challenge
  ```
* cd into the directory
  ```
  cd spanning-challenge
  ```

* If you don't have Node installed, go [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  and install it
* Install the dependencies with your choice of npm or yarn
  ```
  npm install or yarn install
  ```
* Run the demo script
  ```
  npm run demo or yarn demo  (if on Mac or Linux)
    or
  npm run demo-windows or yarn demo-windows (if on Windows)  
  ```
* Your browser window should open up to localhost:3001 and you should now be
  able to enter in a pin (4 characters) and check a balance from a server. I ran out of time to implement the rest of the functionality.
